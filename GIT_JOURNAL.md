What I learned: I learned how to manage branches, resolve merge conflicts, and use tags in Git. 

Mistakes I made: I accidentally edited on the wrong branch and once broke a merge by using a binary file. 

Commands that saved the day: The `git merge --abort` and `git log` commands helped me debug and navigate fixing the issue.
